## Brief description
EderCare is an IoT system designed to enhance the well-being of elderly individuals by providing continuous health monitoring and emergency response capabilities. The dedicated [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/SmartHealth23Bot) provides a means for the doctor to interact with the sistem enabling them to:
- Manage patients
- Manage caregivers
- Retrieve real-time data (oxygen saturation, body temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate) 

Edercare is equipped to detect values that fall out of the predefined health range (checks if the patient is resting or doing exercises). In such cases, it automatically triggers emergency calls to both the doctor and the caregivers. The rapid response mechanisms ensures immediate attention and care during critical situations.
